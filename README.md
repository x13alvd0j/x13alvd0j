# About this project


This is NOT a part of GNU/Emacs.

This is just a personal configuration project to make Emacs, the most powerful text editor, more convenient to me.

This project belongs to Cabins, an SDET(Software Developer Engineer in Test) from China.

## About Programming language

I mainly use Python & Go in my work.  So I set up the programming environments for this two languages with LSP - the protocol from Microsoft.  If you use other languages, such as JavaScript, C++, and so on, you can easily set up for them with LSP - sometimes you just install the language servers, Emacs config code does NOT need to change.

## Installation

Launch a terminal, such as:

- `Terminal` App or `iTerm2` on macOS
- `GNOME Terminal` or `Konsole` on GNU/Linux
- `CMD` or `PowerShell` on Windows 10

Run the code below, and then launch your Emacs, enjoy it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cabins/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```

> Note: If you use Windows 10,  you should set an environment variable named `HOME`,  and set its value to your user directory,  like `C:/Users/<your_name>`.

## Testing

- macOS,  10.14.6,  GUI mode
