# About this project

This is NOT a part of GNU/Emacs.  This is just a personal configuration project to make Emacs, the most powerful text editor, more convenient to me.

This project belongs to Cabins, a test-dev engineer from China.

## About Peogramming language

I mainly use Python & Go in my work.  So I set up the program environments for this two languages with LSP - the protocol from Microsoft.  If you use other languages, such as JavaScript, C++, and so on, you can easily set up for them with LSP - sometimes you just install the language servers, Emacs config code does NOT need to change.

## About bugs

Any issue would be welcomed, just give me an issue if you find something not good for your usage.
